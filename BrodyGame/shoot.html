					>An airplane is a heavier-than-air, fixed-wing aircraft
					powered by engines that produce forward thrust, allowing it
					to generate lift and overcome the forces of drag and weight
					to achieve controlled flight. The main structural components
					include the fuselage, which houses the cockpit, passengers,
					and cargo; wings, designed with a curved airfoil shape to
					create a pressure difference that generates lift; and the
					empennage, or tail section, which provides stability and
					control. The wings are fitted with control surfaces like
					ailerons for roll control and flaps to increase lift and
					drag during takeoff and landing, while the empennage
					features elevators to control pitch and a rudder for yaw.
					Power is supplied by engines—either jet engines that expel
					hot gas for thrust or piston engines that spin
					propellers—with landing gear providing support on the ground
					and retracting during flight to reduce drag. This harmony of
					components, from the intricate avionics in the cockpit to
					the carefully engineered airframe, enables the aircraft to
					navigate and safely transport people and cargo through the
					air...</span
